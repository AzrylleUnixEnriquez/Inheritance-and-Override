# Inheritance-and-Override
Create a base class named Vehicle that contains these variables and methods
- Speed
- Color
- Price
- STOP method

A. create a car sub class for vehicle named ToyotaVios that contains these variables and methods
-Tire type
-drive method

B. create a plane sub class for vehicle named U2SpyPlane that contains these variables and methods
-Wing span
-fly method

C. create a boat sub class for vehicle named FandangoYacht that contains these variables and methods
-Mainsail
-float method

in this code I used hierarchy inheritance where in the car class extends Vehicle, plane class extends Vehicle, the boat class extends Vehicle 

I instantiated the car as beep, plane as woosh, and boat as honk.

I override the stop method in the respective sub class because each vehicle has differents stopping method.

I printed their inherited variables and called the different stop methods from each sub classes.
